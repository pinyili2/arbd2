| Atomic Resolution Brownian Dynamics (ARBD) - alpha Nov 16 |
\===========================================================/

Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation is method for studying biomolecules, ions, and
nanomaterials that balances detail with computational efficiency.

ARBD supports tabulated non-bonded and bonded interactions between BD
particles that can also be influenced by grid-specified
potentials. Uniquely, ARBD also allows grid-specified densities and
potentials to be associated with rigid body particles that rotate and
translate to represent larger molecules. Most importantly, the code is
designed to run quickly on modern NVIDIA GPUs.

ARBD is a rewrite of the BrownianMover code, moving almost all computations to
the GPU and enabling grid-specified particle models. Please be aware that ARBD
is being actively developed and is offered without warranty.

| Installation |
\==============/

To build, please run `make' in the src directory

Note that ARBD was developed using CUDA-8.0 and targets NVIDIA GPUs featuring
6.0 compute capability. The code should still run using older NVIDIA hardware,
but no guarantees are being made.

| Installation |
\==============/

Please explore the examples in the 'tests' directory.

For example, try the following commands:

cd tests/argon
mkdir output
../../src/arbd BrownDyn.bd output/BrownDyn > output/BrownDyn.log
