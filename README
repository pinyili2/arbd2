\============================================/

Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation is method for studying biomolecules, ions, and
nanomaterials that balances detail with computational efficiency.

ARBD supports tabulated non-bonded and bonded interactions between BD particles
that can also be influenced by grid-specified potentials. Uniquely, ARBD also allows grid-specified densities and potentials to be associated with rigid body particles that rotate and translate to represent larger molecules. Most importantly,

Please be aware that ARBD is being actively developed, is offered as alpha
software (bugs may be present) and is offered without warranty.

| Installation |
\==============/

To build, please run `make' in the src directory

Note that ARBD was developed using CUDA-8.0 and targets NVIDIA GPUs featuring
6.0 compute capability. The code should still run using older NVIDIA hardware,
but no guarantees are being made.
