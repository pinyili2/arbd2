| Atomic Resolution Brownian Dynamics (ARBD) - beta Jan 18 |
\==========================================================/

Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation is method for studying biomolecules, ions, and
nanomaterials that balances detail with computational efficiency.

ARBD supports tabulated non-bonded and bonded interactions between BD
particles that can also be influenced by grid-specified
potentials. Uniquely, ARBD also allows grid-specified densities and
potentials to be associated with rigid body particles that rotate and
translate to represent larger molecules. Most importantly, the code is
designed to run quickly on modern NVIDIA GPUs.

ARBD is a rewrite of the BrownianMover code, moving almost all computations to
the GPU and enabling grid-specified particle models. Please be aware that ARBD
is being actively developed and is offered without warranty.

| Building |
\==========/

To build, please run `make' in the src directory.

If your CUDA toolkit is installed in a nonstandard location, you may specify
that location using the CUDA_PATH environment variable. For example:
make CUDA_PATH=/nonstandard/path/to/cuda

Note that ARBD has been developed using CUDA-8.0 and targets NVIDIA GPUs featuring
6.0 compute capability. The code should work with devices with compute capability >=2.0,
but there are no guarantees.

Older versions of CUDA are not compatible with SM 6.0, so you may need to change
the SMS variable in the makefile, or specify it as an argument to make.


/==============\
| Installation |
\==============/

Please explore the examples in the 'tests' directory.

For example, try the following commands:

cd tests/argon-small
mkdir output
../../src/arbd BrownDyn.bd output/BrownDyn > output/BrownDyn.log

You may use the '-g n' option to specify the n-th GPU on your machine, counting from 0.

If you fail to compile and link the applications, we recommend running
`make clean` to remove object files. Sometimes we have encountered
CUDA related errors in binaries built in a "dirty" environment.

| Outstanding issues |
\====================/

-- Features disabled during port to GPUs --

* Energy calculations are currently disabled

* Constant chemical potential simulations

-- Not implemented --

* Periodic boundaries are not handled by rigid body objects, so
  simulations using these should only be performed for effectively
  infinite systems

* There are no checks to ensure that pairlists are recalculated before
  particles further than the pairlist distance move to within the
  cutoff

-- Bugs --

* A large amount of GPU memory for pairlists is allocated statically,
  which may cause out-of-memory crashes in older hardware

* If the number of pairs in the system exceeds the length of the array
  allocated for pairlists, the non-bonded kernel will try to access
  forbidden regions of memory, causing a crash
