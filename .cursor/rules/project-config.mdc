- Metal 4 with Metal-cpp
- CMake for build configuration

## Build Configuration Rules
- Machine-specific configurations,for example, global libraries and folders MUST be placed in [CMakePresets.json](mdc:CMakePresets.json), not in CMakeLists.txt files
- All core math definitions are located in the [Math](mdc:src/Math) folder
