| Atomic Resolution Brownian Dynamics (ARBD) - alpha Nov 16 |
\===========================================================/

Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation is method for studying biomolecules, ions, and
nanomaterials that balances detail with computational efficiency.

ARBD supports tabulated non-bonded and bonded interactions between BD
particles that can also be influenced by grid-specified
potentials. Uniquely, ARBD also allows grid-specified densities and
potentials to be associated with rigid body particles that rotate and
translate to represent larger molecules. Most importantly, the code is
designed to run quickly on modern NVIDIA GPUs.

ARBD is a rewrite of the BrownianMover code, moving almost all computations to
the GPU and enabling grid-specified particle models. Please be aware that ARBD
is being actively developed and is offered without warranty.

| Building |
\==========/

To build, please run `make' in the src directory.

If your CUDA toolkit is installed in a nonstandard location, you may specify
that location using the CUDA_PATH environment variable. For example:
make CUDA_PATH=/nonstandard/path/to/cuda

Note that ARBD was developed using CUDA-8.0 and targets NVIDIA GPUs featuring
6.0 compute capability. The code should work with devices with compute capability >=2.0,
but there are no guarantees.

Older versions of CUDA are not compatible with SM 6.0, so you may need to change
the SMS variable in the makefile, or specify it as an argument to make.


/==============\
| Installation |
\==============/

Please explore the examples in the 'tests' directory.

For example, try the following commands:

cd tests/argon-small
mkdir output
../../src/arbd BrownDyn.bd output/BrownDyn > output/BrownDyn.log

You may use the '-g n' option to specify the n-th GPU on your machine, counting from 0.
