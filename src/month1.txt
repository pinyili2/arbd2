Modernize. Add tests (../Tests/Core, ../Tests/Utils).
CMake: Define arbd_core_types_utils static library target. Ensure compilation.

Focus on C++ Modernization (as per Month 1 plan):

    Primary Reading: Your printed P1: "Effective Modern C++" (finish Ch 5, read Ch 6 on Lambdas).
    Code Work: Go through the files listed in the target_sources of your new src/CMakeLists.txt (e.g., Core/Types.h, Core/Types/Array.h, Core/common.h, Core/ARBDException.h/cpp, Core/SignalManager.h/cpp, Core/MemoryManager.h, Core/Proxy.h, Core/useful.h).
        Apply smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) for resource management.
        Use auto where appropriate.
        Improve class design (Rule of Zero/Three/Five).
        Use lambdas if they simplify code.
    Refactoring Mindset: Skim the suggested chapters from your ebook E0: "Refactoring with C++" (Danilov) to guide how you approach improving this code.

Focus on CUDA Basics (as per Month 1 plan):

    Primary Reading: NVIDIA Programming Guide (Device Memory, Error Handling, Kernel Launches, basic Streams).
    Code Work:
        Ensure Core/useful.cu and Core/Random/Random.cu (and Core/Backend/Resource.cu) compile correctly.
        Implement robust CUDA error checking around all API calls in these files.
        Implement RAII wrappers (e.g., std::unique_ptr with custom deleters) for cudaMalloc/cudaFree in Resource.cu or a new helper class.
        Start understanding and applying basic CUDA streams in Core/Backend/GPU/GPUManager.cpp (if you start working on its internals).

Phase 0: CMake & Build System Finalization (Quick Check/Refinement)

    Files: arbd2v/CMakeLists.txt, arbd2v/src/CMakeLists.txt
    Action:
        Quickly review your CMake files against the revised versions I provided previously. Ensure:
            C++20 and a suitable CUDA standard (e.g., C++17 for CUDA) are set.
            CUDA architectures are correctly specified.
            The arbd_lib in src/CMakeLists.txt lists the initial set of files for Month 1 (see below).
            src/arbd.cpp (minimal version) compiles and links against arbd_lib.
        Ensure Backend/GPU/CudaMemory.h (and its dependency ARBDException.h) can be included and used by other files that will need it. Add ARBDException.h/cpp to src/CMakeLists.txt early.
    Rationale: A stable build system is essential before diving deep into code changes.

Phase 1: Foundational C++ Utilities & Error Handling

    Files & Order:
        Core/ARBDException.h, Core/ARBDException.cpp (Target: src/Utils/System/)
            Action: Review and modernize. Ensure it's robust as your CudaMemory.h depends on it. Use std::string for messages. Ensure it derives from std::exception or a suitable standard exception.
            P1 Ref: Class design.
        Core/common.h (Target: src/Core/Common/)
            Action: Review for macros that can be replaced with constexpr variables, enum class, or inline functions for type safety and clarity.
        Core/SignalManager.h, Core/SignalManager.cpp (Target: src/Utils/System/)
            Action: Review for modern C++ practices. Ensure any resource management is sound (likely static, but good to check).
        type_name.h (from src/, Target: src/Utils/Misc/)
            Action: Modernize if needed (e.g., use std::string).

Phase 2: Core C++ Data Structures Modernization

    Files & Order:
        Core/Types/Vector3.h, Core/Types/Matrix3.h (Target: src/Core/Types/)
            Action: Apply "Effective Modern C++" (P1): constructors (Rule of Zero/Three/Five), noexcept, constexpr where possible. Ensure auto works well with them.
        Core/Types/Bitmask.h (Target: src/Core/Types/)
            Action: Review for type safety. Consider enum class for underlying bits if it makes sense.
        Core/Types/Array.h (Target: src/Core/Types/)
            Action (Critical): This is a major modernization point.
                Analyze its current implementation (likely raw pointers from P8 context).
                Refactor to use std::vector internally if it's a dynamic array, or std::array if fixed-size known at compile time. If it must remain custom for specific CUDA interop reasons not covered by std::vector's .data(), then refactor its internal memory management to use std::unique_ptr for its buffer.
                Implement proper copy/move constructors/assignment operators (Rule of Zero/Three/Five from P1).
        Core/Types.h (Target: src/Core/Types/)
            Action: Update to reflect changes in individual type files. Ensure it only includes what's necessary.

Phase 3: Integrating CudaMemory.h & Modernizing CUDA-Related C++ Management Code

    Files & Order:
        Core/Backend/Resource.h, Core/Backend/Resource.cu (Target: src/Backend/Common/)
            Action:
                This is a prime candidate to immediately use your cuda::DeviceMemory<T> from Backend/GPU/CudaMemory.h for any device memory it manages.
                Replace raw cudaMalloc/cudaFree calls with instantiations of cuda::DeviceMemory.
                Ensure all CUDA API calls are wrapped with your CUDA_CHECK macro.
                Modernize the C++ aspects of the class.
        Core/Backend/GPU/* (GPUManager files) (Target: src/Backend/Gpu/)
            Action:
                Refactor GPUManager.h and GPUManager.cpp.
                Use your cuda::Stream and cuda::Event RAII wrappers for all stream and event management.
                Implement/modernize init() and the basic multi-GPU initialization logic.
                Ensure all CUDA API calls are wrapped with CUDA_CHECK.
                P1 Ref: Class design, resource management.
                P4 Ref: GPU architecture, CUDA programming model.
                NVIDIA ProgGuide: Streams, Events, Device Management.
        Core/MemoryManager.h, Core/Proxy.h (Target: src/Core/Memory/)
            Action:
                Review how these interact with GPU memory. If Proxy needs to manage or refer to device-side buffers, it should now interact with Resource or GPUManager instances that use cuda::DeviceMemory, or use cuda::DeviceMemory directly if appropriate.
                Modernize their C++ aspects (smart pointers for any host-side owned data, move semantics).
                P1 Ref: Smart pointers, move semantics.

Phase 4: Initial Modernization of Basic CUDA Utility & Random Number Files

    Files & Order:
        Core/useful.h (CPU parts), Core/useful.cu (CUDA parts) (Targets: src/Utils/Math/useful.h, src/Utils/Math/useful.cu)
            Action (useful.h): Extract general C++ utilities. Modernize them (e.g., std::string_view, std::optional).
            Action (useful.cu):
                Identify __host__ __device__ functions and simple utility kernels.
                Ensure they compile with your updated CMake.
                Review kernel launch parameters (<<<...>>>) if any are called from host code in this file. Understand the grid/block dimensions.
                Apply CUDA_CHECK to any runtime API calls.
                If any temporary device memory is used, consider if cuda::DeviceMemory is applicable for small, scoped allocations.
        Core/Random/Random.h, Core/Random/Random_old.h, Core/Random/Random.cu (Targets: src/Core/Random/Random.h, .../RandomCPU.h, .../RandomGPU.cu)
            Action:
                Modernize the C++ interface in Random.h.
                Refactor Random_old.h into a modern C++ RandomCPU.h (and potentially a .cpp).
                For RandomGPU.cu:
                    Understand its kernel(s) â€“ thread indexing, memory access patterns.
                    If it manages its own state on the GPU (e.g., CURAND generator states), use cuda::DeviceMemory for that state if it was previously raw cudaMalloc.
                    Ensure kernel launches are correct, use your cuda::Stream wrapper if asynchronous execution is intended, and all API calls are error-checked with CUDA_CHECK.
                    NVIDIA ProgGuide/API_Ref: CURAND library if it's used.
