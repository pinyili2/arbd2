* grid
** Q: overhead of dynamic parallelism?
** Q: overhead of classes? 
	 Member data can't be shared

** TODO read up on:
*** dynamic parallelism
*** registers
* TODO decide whether to write a monolithic kernel or to break problem into subkernel launches



* optimize algorithms for cuda (balance floating point calculation with memory transfers)
** parallize loops
** subthreads
** new algorithms may be improved through new data structures; introduce 
*** RigidBodyGrid: methods pulled from BaseGrid, but transforms passed to functions 
**** no wrapping

* pairlists for rigid bodies 
** maybe for grids, depending on parallel structure of code

* other ideas
** interpolate density grids?
